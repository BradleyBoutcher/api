        progress:
          type: integer
          description: If progress has been made, and the progress can be measured numerically, this will be the value of that progress. You can compare it to the DestinyObjectiveDefinition.completionValue property for current vs. upper bounds, and use DestinyObjectiveDefinition.valueStyle to determine how this should be rendered. Note that progress, in Destiny 2, need not be a literal numeric progression. It could be one of a number of possible values, even a Timestamp. Always examine DestinyObjectiveDefinition.valueStyle before rendering progress.

            As of Forsaken, objectives'' completion value is determined dynamically at runtime.
            This value represents the threshold of progress you need to surpass in order for this objective to be considered "complete".
            If you were using objective data, switch from using the DestinyObjectiveDefinition''s "completionValue" to this value.'
