      description: "If you're going to report someone for a Terms of Service violation, you need to choose a category and reason for the report. This definition holds both the categories and the reasons within those categories, for simplicity and my own laziness' sake.
      Note tha this means that, to refer to a Reason by reasonHash, you need a combination of the reasonHash *and* the associated ReasonCategory's hash: there are some reasons defined under multiple categories."
